### Crimstopia
The Republic of Crimstopia was made during 2001 in the ruins of the Java Island after a nuclear war broke out between the Americans and Soviets, they grew rather slowly due to the lack of land thanks to the fact they are in an island, this caused them to expand to the entirity of Indonesia and eventually the entire south-east asia including Australia and New Zealand.

They were stopped from expanding during 2026 thanks to the Vestige, Drakhonikans and Goldenhands, the Vestige were extremely hostile towards them due to their opposing cultures, this caused them to go to war in 2027 which was ended in 2033 after the Crimstopians captured the capital of the Vestige. The Goldenhands on the other hand simply co-existed with them thanks to careful trade and smooth negotiations but they are still rather guarded against each other, the only thing stopping the Crimstopians from attacking the Goldenhands were due to the fact that the Goldenhand threatened to trade their resources to the Vestige. (they still did, but in secret) The Drakhonikans and Crimstopians respected each other's military power and made neutral borders to seperate their cultures from angering each-other.

Thanks to the war in 2027-2033, the Scarlet Legion was informed of the existance of the Crimstopians and launched a massive naval attack against the Crimstopians in 2035 directly onto their coastal capital, while the Scarlets managed to capture the capital, the Crimstopians managed to liberate their city once again and the war is ended in a stalemate.

In 2040, the Crimstopians gave the Australians and New Zealanders independence due to the fact that their geography and culture was so different and thus hard to control, these two countries soon became Yellowstread in 2042.

In 2045, the Crimstopians traded the territory formerly owned by the Vestige with the Goldenhands, the Goldenhands sold this territory to a wealthy artist, this said territory became the home for the Starholds. This however also revived the Vestige as said artist gave them territory deep inside of their own, this heavily angered the Crimstopians but the Goldenhands reminded them that they can easily destroy their economy.

### Vestige
The Vestige Empire was created in 2003 in the ruins of Italy after a nuclear war, they grew at a moderate and consistent pace thanks to their large territory and soon expanded deep into the rest of europe, expanding into England and Iceland in 2010. They stopped expanding in 2021 after meeting the Goldenhands, which paid them to not expand, the Vestige accepted this offer.

In 2026, the Crimstopians found the Vestige, they were rather neutral towards each other, but due to the fact that the Crimstopians were expanding into the lands which the Vestige was paid not to and also due to the fact that their culture insults each other, the Vestige soon became extremely hostile to the Crimstopians which resulted in a massive war in 2027, the war ended in 2033 where the rest of the Vestige army surrendered after their capital was captured and their leader taken into custody.

in 2046, the Vestige were revived thanks to the Starholds but is living in pressure as they are simply a puppet to them thanks to the Starhold's superior military power.
